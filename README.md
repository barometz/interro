interro
=======
A python module to interactively extract information from users.

Interro essentially provides an interactive questionnaire with live data
validation. The idea originally came up when a shell server needed an
automated signup process through IRC. The code at that time was massively
inflexible and ugly to boot, but interro is intended to be both flexible and
generic, without making it a hassle to set up.

Currently only a single list of open questions is supported, but plans for the
future include multiple choice, more explicitly optional questions and
possibly some amount of response-based branching.

Usage
-----
To be documented.  See interro-demo.py for current details.  May change significantly.
